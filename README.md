# threat-feed

A daily digest of vulnerabilities newly added to CISA's
[Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog),
ranked by [EPSS](https://www.first.org/epss/) exploit-probability score.

A GitHub Action runs `digest.py` every morning. When CISA has added
entries since the last run, it writes a digest to `digests/YYYY/` and
updates the table below. Days with nothing new produce no commit.

## Latest

## How it works

- **Source:** CISA KEV JSON feed: vendor, product, required action, remediation due date, ransomware use
- **Enrichment:** FIRST EPSS API: probability of exploitation in the next 30 days, plus percentile
- **State:** `state/seen.json` tracks CVE IDs already reported, so each entry appears once
- **No dependencies:** Python standard library only
